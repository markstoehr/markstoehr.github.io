I'm a PhD student at the University of Chicago finishing a thesis on neural
embeddings for speech recognition.   *The views represented here are my own and
do not represent the views of University of Chicago.*

I'll be posting ideas I find interesting, code samples I've found useful,
discussing data science articles, and sharing advice about how to get started in
Data Science and Machine Learning.

Thanks for reading!
